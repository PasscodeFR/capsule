1. Figure out a good way to handle sections and taxonomies (categories & tags).
2. Create a shortcode for figures (and override the default one) that supports:
   - multiple src images
   - Bulma classes (the "image" class could be problematic...)
   - styled figcaptions with titles, subtitles, etc.

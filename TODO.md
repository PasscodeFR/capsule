1. Add shortcodes for responsive:
    - blockquotes (keep markdown whitespace)
    - images
    - banners
    - videos (iframes)

2. Add terms.html and add limits to # taxonomies listed on the home page
   sidebar. Try to order the taxonomies either by weight or alphabetically. The
   goal is to make sure the sidebar doesn't extend below the list of posts.

3. Add OpenGraph/Twitter/etc metadata to the head partial.

4. Add metadata variables for adding custom js or css to a particular page.

5. Figure out a good way to handle sections and taxonomies (categories & tags).
